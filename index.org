* Futures and Forwards

Futures and forwards are used by firms in the same way in order to manage risk.  Futures and forwards simply differ in the manner in which they are traded, and the standardization of the contract.

- In this presentation we'll refer to *futures*, but much of the content can be generalized to forwards also.

* Who Trades Futures?

Broadly speaking, there are two types of traders in futures markets, hedgers and speculators.

-  Hedgers: Companies who use futures to manage risk.  They generally buy futures contract on product they consume, and sell contracts on products they produce.

-  Speculators: Individuals and firms who trade futures contracts based on expectations of future prices.  This is risk taking behavior.

Types of traders and their aggregate positions are summarized in the [CFTC Commitment of Traders Report](http://www.cftc.gov/Marketreports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm).

* Hedgers

Say you are a deregulated utility which operates a natural-gas fired power plant.  Your business requires you to buy natural gas and sell electricity.  The prices of both gas and electricity freely fluctuate.

- In this case your company would be more profitable if the difference between the gas and electricity prices rises, and less profitable if it falls.

* The Role of Speculators

Speculators play an important role by taking the other side of order imbalances between hedgers. Without speculators, hedgers would have to wait for other hedgers to trade (causing the market maker to widen bid-ask spreads).

#+begin_quote
Speculators temporarily hold the order imbalance between hedgers in exchange for a return.
#+end_quote

Futures markets exist to allow hedging, and not for speculation.  That said, without speculators the futures markets would be more likely to fail because transaction costs (bid-ask spread) would increase.

* Understanding Futures Prices

All futures prices are affected by interest rates.  Beyond that, futures prices are driven by storage costs and convenience yields.

[[https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/storage/dashboard/][We can take a look at the EIA's Natural Gas Storage Dashboard to start to understand futures pricing.]]

* Futures Prices by Delivery




* Open Interest

For convenience sake, we are inexact when we use the term `buy` or `sell` a futures contract.  What we mean when we say `buy` (or `sell`) is we enter into contract today to buy (or sell) the underlying at some set point in the future, for the futures price.  So when we buy or sell we *create* a contract, and if we close a position we *remove* a contract.  The number of contracts that are in existence at any point is call *open interest*.
